## Description

E-Commerce Back End provides you with the software you need to get the edge against your competition.  This lightweight application seemlessly breaks down your product into easy-to-use categories, products, and tags so you can keep track of your inventory.  Categories allows you to assign a theme to all of your products.  Tags allows you to assign keywords to your various products, which will allow an associated front end to search them to display your products according to what your customers need.  Utilizing Sequelize allows for you to create new categories, tags, and products.  It also allows you to update existing ones, and delete ones that you no longer carry in stock.  This software is also set up to function as an API.  This allows you to connect it to any customized front end.  It can even be used without any front end via Insomnia, provided you have an understanding of JSON.  
  
## Installation

## Usage
  
This app can be used without a front end via Insomnia.  It can also be hooked up to a front end and used as an API.
